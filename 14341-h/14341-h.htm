    <h2>PARLIAMENT IN SPORT;</h2>

    <h3><i>Or, A Meeting in Earnest.</i></h3>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>["Perhaps the popularity of the competition in national
        sport between the different parts of the Empire is worthy
        of the serious attention of statesmen ... Mr. ASTLEY COOPER
        proposes rowing, running and cricket ... There is something
        fascinating in the idea of such a Pan-Britannic
        gathering."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper</i>.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The SPEAKER, having taken his seat in the Pavilion, the
    Minister for Cricket rose to move the third reading of The
    Six-balls-to-an-over Bill.</p>

    <p>The Right Hon. Gentleman said that the amount of time wasted
    in changing sides, although the field did their best to
    minimise the loss by assuming a couple of positions
    alternately, was very serious&mdash;especially in a first-class
    match.</p>

    <p>The Member for Melbourne begged to ask what <i>was</i> a
    first-class match?</p>

    <p>The Member for Sydney replied, certainly not a match between
    Canada and Victoria. (<i>Laughter.)</i> Now everyone was aware
    that New South Wales&mdash;("<i>Question! Order! Order!")</i>
    He begged pardon, he was in order.</p>

    <p>The SPEAKER. I really must request silence. The Minister for
    Cricket is introducing a most important measure, and the least
    we can do is to receive his statement with adequate attention.
    (<i>General cheering</i>.)</p>

    <p>The Minister for Cricket continued, and said that the
    measure he had the honour to commend to their careful
    consideration would not only lengthen the over, but also allow
    Cricket to be played all the year round.</p>

    <p>The Minister for Football begged to remind his Right Hon.
    friend that he had promised to consider that matter in
    Committee. What would become of Football were Cricket to be
    played continuously? ("<i>Hear, hear</i>!")</p>

    <p>The Member for Bombay thought that a matter of no moment. In
    India Polo was of infinitely more importance than Football, and
    he could not help remarking that, in the Imperial Parliament,
    representing so many sports, and so many Colonies, where every
    great interest was represented, and well represented, Polo was
    absolutely ignored. (<i>Cheers.)</i></p>

    <p>The Minister for Aquatic Sports agreed with the Hon. Member.
    Polo was entirely of sufficient interest to warrant the
    creation of a special department for its guardianship. But at
    present he was responsible for it. He hoped soon to be able to
    welcome a colleague who would make its interests his continual
    study. ("<i>Hear, hear!</i>")</p>

    <p>The Minister for Cricket concluded by thanking the House for
    the attention the Hon. Members had given to the subject, and
    sat down amidst loud applause.</p>

    <p>A division being taken, the Bill was carried by 127 to 96.
    The majority were composed of Australians and Canadians, and
    the minority were Africans, Indians, and miscellaneous
    Colonists. The House then adjourned.</p>

        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>Near Torcello</i>. CULCHARD <i>and</i>
        PODBURY <i>are seated side by side in the gondola, which is
        threading its way between low banks, bright with clumps of
        Michaelmas daisies and pomegranate-trees laden with red
        fruit. Both</i> CULCHARD <i>and</i> PODBURY <i>are secretly
        nervous and anxious for encouragement.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>humming "In Old Madrid" with
    sentiment</i>). La-doodle-um-La-doodle-oo:
    La-doodle-um-te-dumpty-loodle-oo! I think she rather seemed to
    like me&mdash;those first days at Brussels, don't
    <i>you</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>absently</i>). Did she? I daresay.
    (<i>Whistling "The Wedding March" softly</i>.) Few-fee;
    di-fee-fee-few-few; few-fiddledy-fee-fiddledy-few-few-few-fee.
    I fancy I'm right in my theory, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh, I should say so&mdash;yes. <i>What</i>
    theory?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). What theory? Why, the one
    I've been explaining to you for the last ten
    minutes!&mdash;that all this harshness of hers lately is
    really, when you come to analyse it, a decidedly encouraging
    symptom.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> But I shouldn't nave said Miss TROTTER was
    exactly <i>harsh</i> to me&mdash;lately, at all events.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with impatience</i>). Miss TROTTER! You!
    What an egotist you are, my dear fellow! I was referring to
    myself and Miss PRENDERGAST. And you can't deny that, both at
    Nuremberg and Constance, she&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with careless optimism</i>). Oh,
    <i>she</i>'ll come round all right, never fear. I only wish I
    was half as safe with Miss TROTTER!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>mollified</i>). Don't be too downhearted,
    my dear PODBURY. I happen to know that she likes you&mdash;she
    told me as much last night. Did Miss
    PRENDERGAST&mdash;er&mdash;say anything to that effect about
    <i>me</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Well,&mdash;not exactly, old chap&mdash;not to
    me, at least. But I say, Miss TROTTER didn't tell you
    <i>that</i>? Not <i>really</i>? Hooray! Then it's all
    right&mdash;she may have me, after all!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>chillingly</i>). I should advise you not
    to be over confident. (<i>A silence follows, which endures
    until they reach the landing-steps at Torcello.</i>) They
    <i>are</i> here, you see&mdash;those are evidently their
    gondolas, I recognise those two cloaks. Now the best thing
    <i>we</i> can do is to separate.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>springing out</i>). Right you are! (<i>To
    himself.</i>) I'll draw the church first, and see if she's
    there. (<i>Approaches the door of Santa Maria: a Voice within,
    apparently reading aloud: "Six balls, or rather almonds, of
    purple marble veined with white are set around the edge of the
    pulpit, and form its only decoration"</i>) HYPATIA, by Jove!
    Narrow shave that! [<i>He goes round to back.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>comes up to the door</i>). I know I shall
    find her here. Lucky I know that Torcello chapter in "The
    Stones" very nearly by heart! (<i>Reaches threshold. A Voice
    within. "Well, I guess I'm going to climb up and sit in that
    old amphitheatre there, and see how it feels!"</i>) Good
    heavens,&mdash;<i>MAUD</i>! and I was as nearly as
    possible&mdash;I think I'll go up to the top of the Campanile
    and see if I can't discover where HYPATIA is.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He ascends the tower.</i></p>

    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>arriving breathless, and finding</i>
    CULCHARD <i>craning eagerly forward</i>). Oh, so <i>you</i>
    came up too? Well, can you <i>see</i> her?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Ssh! She's just turned the corner!
    (<i>Vexed.</i>) She's with Miss TROTTER!... They're sitting
    down on the grass below!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Together? That's a nuisance! Now we shall have
    to wait till they separate&mdash;sure to squabble, sooner or
    later.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s Voice</i> (<i>which is perfectly audible
    above</i>). I guess we'll give RUSKIN a rest now, HYPATIA. I'm
    dying for a talk. I'm just as enchanted as I can be to hear
    you've dismissed Mr. PODBURY. And I expect you can guess
    <i>why</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>in a whisper</i>). I say, CULCHARD, they're
    going to talk about us. Ought we to listen, eh? Better let them
    know we're here?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I really don't see any
    necessity&mdash;however&mdash;(<i>Whistles feebly.</i>)

    <p><i>Podb.</i> What is the use of fustling like that?
    (<i>Yödels.</i>) Lul-li-ety!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.'s V.</i> Well, my dear MAUD, I confess that
    I&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> It's quite impossible to make them hear down
    there, and it's no fault of ours if their voices reach us
    occasionally. And it <i>does</i> seem to me, PODBURY, that, in
    a matter which may be of vital importance to me&mdash;to us
    both&mdash;it would be absurd to be over-scrupulous. But of
    course you will please yourself. <i>I</i> intend to remain
    where I am.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[PODBURY <i>makes a faint-hearted attempt to go, but
        ends by resigning himself to the situation.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s V.</i> Now, HYPATIA PRENDERGAST, don't tell
    <i>me</i> you're not interested in him! And he's more real
    suited to you than ever Mr. PODBURY was. Now, isn't that
    <i>so</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>withdrawing his head</i>). Did you hear,
    PODBURY? She's actually pleading for me! <i>Isn't</i> she an
    angel? Be quiet, now. I must hear the answer!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.'s V.</i> I&mdash;I don't know, really. But, MAUD,
    I want to speak to you about&mdash;Somebody. You can't think
    how he adores you, poor fellow! I have noticed it for a long
    time.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>beaming</i>). CULCHARD! You heard? She's
    putting in a word for me. What a brick that girl is!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s V.</i> I guess he's pretty good at concealing
    his feelings, then. He's been keeping far enough away!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.'s V.</i> That was <i>my</i> fault. I <i>kept</i>
    him by me. You see, I believed you had quite decided to accept
    Mr. CULCHARD.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s V.</i> Well, it does strike me that,
    considering he was adoring me all this time, he let himself be
    managed tolerable easy.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[PODBURY <i>shakes his head in protestation.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss P.'s V.</i> Ah, but let me explain. I could only
    keep him quiet by threatening to go home by myself, and dear
    BOB is such a devoted brother that&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Brother! I say. CULCHARD, she can't be meaning
    <i>BOB</i> all this time! She <i>can't</i>! Can she now?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> How on earth can <i>I</i> tell? If it is so,
    you must be a philosopher, my dear fellow, and bear
    it&mdash;that's all.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.'s V.</i> That <i>does</i> alter the case, doesn't
    it? And I may tell him there's some hope for him? You mustn't
    judge him by what he is with his friend, Mr. PODBURY. BOB has
    such a <i>much</i> stronger and finer character!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s V.</i> Oh well, if he couldn't stand up more on
    his edge than Mr. PODBURY! Not that I mind Mr. PODBURY any,
    there's no harm in him, but he's too real frivolous to amount
    to much.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>collapsing</i>). Frivolous! From <i>her</i>
    too! Oh, hang it <i>all</i>!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He buries his head in his hands with a
        groan.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s V.</i> Well, see here, HYPATIA. I'll take your
    brother on trial for a spell, to oblige you&mdash;there. I
    cann't say more at present. And now&mdash;about the other. I
    want to know just how you feel about him.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> The <i>other</i>!&mdash;that's Me! I wish to
    goodness you wouldn't make all that noise, PODBURY, just when
    it's getting interesting!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.'s V.</i> (<i>very low</i>). What is the good?
    Nothing will bring him back&mdash;<i>now</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Nothing? How little she knows me!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s V.</i> I hope you don't consider <i>me</i>
    nothing. And a word from me would bring him along pretty smart.
    The only question is, whether I'm to say it or not?</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.'s V.</i> (<i>muffled</i>). Dar-ling!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I really think I might almost venture to go
    down, now, eh, PODBURY? (<i>No answer.</i>) Selfish brute!
    [<i>Indignantly.</i></p>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s V.</i> But mind this&mdash;if he comes, you've
    got to care for him the whole length of your boa&mdash;you
    won't persuade him to run in couples with anybody else. That's
    why he broke away the first time&mdash;and you were ever so mad
    with me because you thought I was at the bottom of it. But it
    was all his pride. He's too real independent to share chances
    with anybody alive.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> How thoroughly she understands me!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s V.</i> And I guess CHARLEY will grow out of the
    great Amurrcan Novel in time&mdash;it's not going ever to grow
    out of <i>him</i>, anyway!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>bewildered</i>). CHARLEY? I don't see why
    she should mention VAN BOODELER <i>now</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s V.</i> I like CHARLEY ever so much, and I'm not
    going to have him cavort around along with a circus of suitors
    under <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> vows. So, if I thought there
       was any chance of&mdash;well, say Mr. CULCHARD&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.'s V.</i> (<i>indignant</i>). MAUD! how <i>can</i>
    you? That odious hypocritical creature! If you knew how I
    despised and&mdash;!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.'s V.</i> Well, my dear, he's pretty
    paltry&mdash;but we'll let him go at that&mdash;I guess his
    shares have gone down considerable all round.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> PODBURY, I&mdash;I&mdash;this conversation is
    evidently not intended for&mdash;for other&mdash;ears. I don't
    know whether <i>you</i> have heard enough, <i>I</i> shall go
    down!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>with a ghastly chuckle</i>). Like your
    shares, eh, old chap? And mine too, for that matter. Well,
    <i>I'm</i> ready enough to go. Only, for goodness' sake, let's

    <h2>A PALMY DAY AT ST. RAPHAEL.</h2>

    <p><i>Villa Magali.</i>&mdash;Delicious climate! STUART-RENDEL
    says it "reminds him of Devonshire, without the damp." Mention
    of Devonshire reminds <i>me</i> of the DUKE. Try to point out
    to my friends that the Rossendale Election shows
    conclusively&mdash;Curious! Friends all get up and go out!
    Seems that ANDREW CLARKE specially told them I was to "avoid
    all excitement, over-exertion, and talk about politics!" Wish
    CLARKE would not be so unreasonable. <i>Must</i> talk about
    Rossendale to somebody.</p>

    <p><i>Off to Hyères</i>&mdash;to see CHILDERS. Find CHILDERS
    tolerably chatty. Doesn't seem to care so much about Rossendale
    result as I should have expected. STUART-RENDEL comes to fetch
    me. Ahem! Off.</p>

    <p><i>At Monte Carlo.</i>&mdash;Feel so well, have looked in
    here. Meet WELLS, the "Champion Plunger." Asks me if I've got a
    system; he's "been losing heavily, and would be glad of any
    hint." Suggest his putting on the numbers of Rossendale
    Majority. WELLS seems pleased at idea. Does so at once, and
    loses 10,000 francs straight off. Meet him in grounds
    afterwards, and try to explain real significance of Rossendale
    election. WELLS disappears. Curious! <i>Can</i> ANDREW CLARKE
    have got at WELLS?</p>

    <p><i>Golfe San Juan.</i>&mdash;French war-ships in Bay.
    Admiral might like to know my views on Rossendale and politics

    victory. Admiral asks if it was the "<i>Grand Prix</i>" that
    MADEN won? Find he thinks MADEN is a horse. Disappointing.
    [<i>Query</i>&mdash;ANDREW CLARKE again?] Sent on shore in
    boat, amid cheers from sailors. Gratifying.</p>

    <p><i>Back to St. Raphael.</i>&mdash;Tired, but on the whole
    gratified with my day. Friends pained to hear what I've done,
    and threaten to telegraph for Sir ANDREW! Shall pack up and
    return. Letter from MORLEY begging me to stay where I am. Odd!

    <h2>HIGH (BEERBOHM) TREESON!</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;I see that Mr. BEERBOHM TREE in his
    recent production of <i>Hamlet</i> has introduced a novelty
    into the tragedy by inventing fresh business. Unauthorised by
    the text, he has included <i>Ophelia</i> amongst the Court
    "attendants," and, finding her on the stage, has indulged in a
    dignified flirtation (in dumb show), worthy of the hero of
    <i>L'Enfant Prodigue</i> himself. Now I think this a great
    improvement, and were the masterpiece to be "written up"
    throughout on the same lines, I am sure the representation
    would be received with enthusiasm. It might be that the
    performance would be a little longer, but think of the enormous
    gain in interest. To show you what I mean, I take the first
    five lines of the opening Act:&mdash;</p>

    <h4>SHAKSPEARE'S VERSION.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Elsinore. A Platform before the
        Castle.</i> FRANCISCO <i>on his post. Enter to him</i>
        BERNARDO.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p><i>Bernardo.</i> Who's there?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p><i>Francisco.</i> Nay answer me: stand and unfold
            yourself!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This passage, furnished with proper business, might be
    rendered the means of showing the sort of life led by
    <i>Laertes</i>, justifying the advice subsequently given to him
    by <i>Polonius</i> more appropriate to the conditions of the
    case as now (for the first time) fully divulged, Thus&mdash;I
    give my view of the matter:&mdash;</p>

    <h4>AMENDED VERSION.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Elsinore. A Platform before the
        Castle. As the Curtain rises, shouts and laughs are heard
        without. A Village Maiden rushes in, as if pursued. She
        hides herself behind the sentry-box, and then escapes.</i>
        FRANCISCO, <i>who is on his post, looks about, and is
        surrounded by Danish Gallants, who have come in pursuit of
        the Maiden. He threatens them with his arms, and only one
        remains, who seems overcome by wine. The intoxicated
        Gallant is masked, and evidently very much the worse for
        liquor. He clumsily draws his sword.</i> FRANCISCO <i>is
        about to despatch him, when the mask falls, and in the
        dissipated reveller the Sentry recognises the bloated
        features of</i> LAERTES. <i>He immediately presents arms,
        as</i> LAERTES <i>is his superior officer.</i> LAERTES,
        <i>half-sobered by this suggestion of discipline, wishes to
        retire unseen, and gives largesse to</i> FRANCISCO. <i>The
        Sentry is greatly gratified, when to them enters</i>
        BERNARDO.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Ber.</i> Who's there?</p>

        <p><i>Fran.</i> (<i>sheltering</i> LAERTES, <i>who stealthily
        retires by a rope-ladder which falls from the battlements
        to the moat below</i>). Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold
        yourself!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>By my version I really introduce a most interesting
    underplot, which, in my opinion, is equally pleasing and quite
    as defensible as Mr. BEERBOHM TREE's business with
    <i>Ophelia</i>.</p>

    <h2>"COME HITHER, HUBERT!"</h2>

    <p>We are able to present our readers with a few notes of a
    lecture to be given by Professor HUBERT HERKOMER, R.A. (by the
    kind permission of AUTHOR PINERO, Esq.), to all managers,
    actors, actresses, scene-painters, authors, composers,
    musicians, costumiers, and wig-makers who will honour him with
    their attention. On this occasion the Professor will (among
    other things) explain, by the aid of a Magic Lantern (an
    entirely new invention recently discovered by Professor H.H.)
    how to enlighten the stage darkness generally. The Professor
    will also combat the erroneous impression derived from the dark
    ages of SHAKSPEARE's time, that the Moon, or the Man in
    it,&mdash;probably a lime-lighterman,&mdash;ought servilely to
    follow the movements, in order to throw light upon them, of the
    Principal Performer. The Professor will observe&mdash;"Such a
    course, on the part of the Direction of the Moon, can only be
    considered beneficial to Art, when it is directed against 'The
    Star System.' As each theatrical Star has its own particular
    brilliancy, why lug in the Moon? SHAKSPEARE, no doubt, had the
    Stage Moon in full view when he makes <i>Juliet</i> roundly
    exclaim, 'Oh, swear not by the Moon, the inconstant Moon!' as,
    of course, a Moon bound to illuminate the business of any one
    actor must follow him about, and so, though 'constant' to
    <i>him</i> individually, would be open to a general charge of
    inconstancy from the spectators in front. Such a course for the
    Moon to take is, as some of the better instructed among you may
    possibly be aware, quite unwarranted by the lunar laws of
    Nature, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>

    <p>This interesting entertainment will wind up with a dialogue
    between <i>Arthur</i> (JONES) and <i>Hubert</i> (HERKOMER), of
    which we give an extract. It represents <i>Arthur</i> as
    wishing to produce a piece, which <i>Hubert</i> forewarns him
    will be a failure unless he (HUBERT) paints the scenery and
    manages it generally.</p>

    <h2>TRUE AND TRUSTY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Story of the Law.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I always liked LAWRENCE LUCKAPENNY, and shall never forget
    the first time I met him. He was leaving the County Court,
    where I had had myself a small matter of business, and knowing
    the same Counsel, we foregathered. He was in great spirits. He
    had just won his case.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said he, "it was a hard fight, but we came off all
    right. His Honour was distinctly in our favour, so now I and my
    co-trustees will have the satisfaction of feeling that the
    estate has benefited, with no greater loss than a few months'
    delay. Eh?" and he turned to our Counsel, who smiled, and shook
    his head a little doubtfully.</p>

    <p>"Can scarcely go so far as that," the man of law observed.
    "You see, these matters take time, and the other side may
    appeal."</p>

    <p>"Appeal! What is that?"</p>

    <p>"I am afraid you will have the full opportunity for
    learning, my dear fellow."</p>

    <p>"Well, it's all right up to now," cried LUCKAPENNY,
    cheerfully, and we separated.</p>

    <p>Two or three years after this I again met the litigant, but
    this time in the Royal Courts of Justice. There were streaks of
    white in his hair, but he was still cheerful.</p>

    <p>I asked him how he was getting on with the matter, and he
    replied, "As well as might be expected." Our Counsel had been
    right, for the liquidators had appealed.</p>

    <p>"But we have beaten them again, my dear Sir! Think of
    that,&mdash;beaten them again!"</p>

    <p>"And now you will have no further difficulty, I
    suppose."</p>

    <p>"I can't go quite so far as that," returned LUCKAPENNY, who
    I noticed was adopting legal phraseology. "You know they may
    take us up to the House of Lords, if they please!"</p>

    <p>And again time went on. In the course of years I found that
    poor LUCKAPENNY <i>had</i> been taken to Westminster, and their
    Lordships had decided to give themselves time to consider their
    judgment.</p>

    <p>When I met LUCKAPENNY again, the House of Lords had decided
    against him.</p>

    <p>"It is very awkward," he observed, "they will not allow my
    costs, and so I shall have to pay them out of my own pocket!
    And what makes it the more annoying is that, even had we won
    our cause, it would have led to nothing, as the estate we were
    fighting is practically bankrupt."</p>

    <p>I offered my condolences, and we separated.</p>

    <p>The last time, I saw poor LUCKAPENNY, he looked a very
    shadow of himself. He was haggard and thin, and was wearing
    clothes of an ancient cut and threadbare material. He smiled as
    he met me, and observed that he was still engaged on the trust
    matter.</p>

    <p>"But I have come to the last stage," he said; "I have paid
    the costs in full. And now I am going home."</p>

    <p>"Going home," I repeated, and noticing that he seemed
    feeble, offered him the support of my arm. "I will walk as far
    as your residence."</p>

    <p>"You are very good," he replied, "but I am afraid that I
    cannot ask you to come in."</p>

    <p>"Never mind that; but where do you live?"</p>

    <p>"Where should I live after a lawsuit?" he returned, with a
    short laugh. "Why, in the Workhouse, to be sure&mdash;in the
    Workhouse!"</p>

    <p>And as a ratepayer, I have assisted to support him ever
    since!</p>

    <h2>IN STATU,&mdash;QUO?</h2>

    <p>Should CROMWELL have a statue at Westminster was a burning
    question some years ago. We all know the result, and nowadays,
    who cares? At present, the question at Oxford is, Shall
    Cardinal NEWMAN have a statue? and, if so, Shall it be just
    opposite the Martyrs' Memorial? From one point of view, the
    situation is happily selected, as, of course, NEWMAN was on
    just exactly opposite ground to CRANMER, RIDLEY, and LATIMER.
    The Oxford Dons are right in supposing that no statue can be
    erected without a previous design; a design by a hand that has
    not lost its cunning. The proposed site is in Broad Street, a
    very suggestive name as opposed to narrowness of any sort; yet
    so eager are the illogical Dons in the matter of preservation
    of spaces, that before even the base of a clay model has been
    commenced, they have already prepared the ground for the
    reception of the statue by getting up any amount of railing
    about the proposed site!</p>

    <h3>No. X.&mdash;TO CROOKEDNESS.</h3>

    <p>OBLIQUE, BUT FORMIDABLE ONE,</p>

    <p>You have frequently fixed your abode in high places. Are
    there not recorded in history the names of kings and statesmen
    whom an irresistible desire to scheme, and trick, and
    overreach, has brought to the block? The times were
    difficult&mdash;that much one may admit. Noble heads of
    honourable and upright men were lopped in profusion; and it may
    be argued, with some show of reason, that the man whose
    character was as flawless as pure crystal, was like to fare as
    badly as the muddiest rascal of them all, if his side sank in
    defeat. And yet I cannot help believing that, in some cases at
    least, a man might have had a happier end if he had abstained
    from acts of political turpitude, which were as irrational in
    their conception as they were ruinous in their effect; acts,
    that is, which, in the existing circumstances, no sane man
    could have undertaken unless the mere doing of these rogueries
    had been a supreme and a necessary pleasure to him. There was
    poor CHARLES THE FIRST. Surely, in spite of that melancholy,
    doomed face, he might have died in peace if he had only played
    the game fairly. JAMES THE SECOND, too, and MARLBOROUGH, the
    greatest Captain of his age, and BOLINGBROKE, the eloquent
    philosophiser, the grave moralist, how different might their
    ends have been had not you, O CROOKEDNESS, presided at their
    births, and ruled their lives. But, avaunt, History! Here I am
    straying into a treatise, when I merely intended to remind you
    of little PETER SHEEF, and of his adventures.</p>

    <p>PETER and I were freshmen together at Cambridge in the
    remote past before "Johnnies," and "Chappies," and "Mashers"
    had been heard of, before the "oof bird" had been fledged in
    its pink and sporting nest, or the Egyptian cigarette had
    asserted its universal sway. I daresay we differed but little
    (by "we" I mean the freshmen of our year) from those who have
    lately appeared for the first time in King's Parade, or Jesus
    Lane. We were very young&mdash;we imagined Proctors to be
    destitute of human feeling; we ate portentous breakfasts of
    many courses, and, for the most part, treated our allowances as
    though they had been so much pocket-money. Also we had an idea
    that a man who had passed his thirtieth year was absurdly old,
    and that nobody could be called a boy whose name had been
    entered on the books of a College. In fact, we were
    freshmen.</p>

    <p>PETER and I were a good deal thrown together during our
    first term. Like me, he had come up from one of the smaller
    schools, and we had not, therefore, a very large number of
    friends to start with. PETER was one of the pleasantest fellows
    in the world, always cheerful, good-tempered, and obliging. He
    always seemed to have plenty of money. Indeed, I know that his
    father made him an allowance of £800 a year, a sum which was
    considerably more than double that received by the majority of
    his fellows. The parental SHEEF I have since discovered was a
    Solicitor, who had made his mark and his fortune by the crafty
    defence of shady financiers in distress, of bogus company
    promoters, and generally of the great race who live in the
    narrow border-land which divides the merely disreputable from
    the positively indictable. But at that time I didn't trouble my
    head to inquire about PETER's father, and was content as most
    Undergraduates are, to take my friends as I thought I found
    them. PETER was musical; he played several instruments with
    skill, and sang a capital song. With all these qualities, he
    soon became, to a certain extent, popular. He then set up as a
    giver of good and expensive dinners, kept a couple of horses in
    the hunting season, devoted great attention to his dress, and
    made himself unobtrusively agreeable to the little gods of our
    miniature world. In his second year he had gained a position;
    most people spoke well of him, and liked him. It only rested
    with PETER himself to maintain what he had gained, and to enter
    on life with troops of friends. A few moments of purposeless
    folly were sufficient to shatter him.</p>

    <p>I remember that in my first term I was not very agreeably
    impressed by something that PETER did. A dog-fancier happened
    to come through the street in which we both lodged, and PETER
    began to bargain with him for a fox-terrier, who, according to
    the fancier's account, had a pedigree as long and as
    illustrious as that of a Norman Peer. Eventually it had been
    agreed that the dog was to become PETER's property in
    consideration of thirty shillings in cash, a pair of trousers,
    and a bottle of brandy. The exchange was made, and the man
    departed. Thereupon PETER informed me with glee, that the
    trousers were a pair of his father's, which had been packed in
    his portmanteau by mistake, and that the brandy-bottle
    contained about fifty per cent. of water, that amount of brandy
    having been poured off before payment was made. As PETER put
    it, "I've done him in the eye, to prevent him doing me." I
    tried in vain to bring him round to the opinion that (let alone
    robbing one's father) cheating a cheat was one of the lowest
    forms of roguery. The dog-fancier soon afterwards returned, and
    protested, with tears in his eyes, that the shabby trick had
    wounded him in his tenderest feelings, but he seemed quite
    willing to begin a fresh bargain with "the only gen'lemen,
    s'help me, as ever bested pore little ALEC."</p>

    <p>All this is, however, by the way. I merely mention it to
    illustrate PETER's character. At the University Steeple-Chase
    Meeting, which took place at the end of our third October term,
    SHEEF had entered his animals for several races. He was a good
    rider, and confidently anticipated success. To celebrate the
    occasion, he had arranged a big dinner-party, and had invited
    some twenty of us to dine with him. I had been unable to go to
    the races myself, but at the appointed hour I turned up at
    SHEEF's rooms. I found the table brilliantly laid, waiters
    hanging about, and dozens of Champagne in readiness. SHEEF was
    there, but, beside myself, no other guest had appeared. And not
    a single one came. I forget what excuse the miserable host
    made, but the result was that we two solemnly dined at a table
    laid for ten times our number. I think I shall remember that
    ghastly festivity as long as I live. The next day all Cambridge
    knew that SHEEF had not only pulled one of his horses openly
    and disgracefully, but had wilfully misled both his friends and
    the book-makers as to the horse he intended to ride in a race
    for which entries were made at the post. I never heard that he
    stood to win more than £50 by the transaction. And for this
    paltry sum (paltry, that is, to a man of his means) he had
    wrecked his reputation, and all the possibilities of his
    career.</p>

    <p>I see him slinking about London sometimes. Last year he
    passed, with much discredit, through the Bankruptcy Court. He
    has been a Director of countless Companies, for the stock of
    fools seems to be inexhaustible. There can only be one end for
    such a man as SHEEF. The cool, callous, and calculating knave
    may get clear through to the end; but SHEEF always was stupidly
    good-natured, and good-nature hangs like a millstone round the
    neck of rascality. I cannot myself detest him as I ought to do.
    He was so near to completely successful respectability. But
    crookedness ruined him, in spite of his better wishes. Was it
    altogether his own fault?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
